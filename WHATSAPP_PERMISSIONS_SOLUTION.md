# WhatsApp API Permissions Error (#10) - Complete Solution Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue
Your WhatsApp Business API is returning error `(#10) Application does not have permission for this action`. This is a common OAuth/permissions issue.

## ✅ Immediate Fixes Applied
1. **Updated API Version**: Changed from v17.0 to v20.0 (latest stable)
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added retry logic and graceful fallbacks
3. **Fallback System**: Interactive messages now fall back to simple text when permissions fail
4. **Better Logging**: Detailed error tracking for debugging

## 🔧 Required Actions (Do These Now)

### Step 1: Update Access Token
1. Go to [Facebook Developers Console](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Select your WhatsApp Business app: "Mohan Sai" (ID: 1996890814445336)
3. Navigate to **WhatsApp > API Setup**
4. Generate a **System User Access Token** (not temporary token)
5. Update your `.env` file:
```bash
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_new_permanent_token_here
```

### Step 2: Verify App Permissions
Ensure these permissions are enabled in your Facebook app:
- ✅ `whatsapp_business_messaging`
- ✅ `whatsapp_business_management` 
- ✅ `business_management`

### Step 3: Phone Number Verification
Your test number (15551677431) shows as verified, but ensure:
